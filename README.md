# Visual-Argument-Repository
My visual argument is meant to invoke feelings and bring awareness to issues surroudning social media and body image. We all know that social media runs rampant with unrealistic body standards and expectations. Being surrounded by such images everywhere we look makes people feel inadequate or not good enough when it comes to their body or self worth. My main point is to say: social media is not real, but you are. It's important to understand that the toll that social media and the influence it has on young people can be extreme, as it can lead to harmful disorders to develop, mentally and physically. I hope that viewers of this image can feel the harmful effects of such an influence. I hope that viewers feel less alone if they may be experiencing such struggles and that they feel motivated to push against the negativity.
