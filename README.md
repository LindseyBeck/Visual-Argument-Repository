# Visual-Argument-Repository
This is a very rough draft version/concept for my visual argument. I want to empahsize the importance of self-love and the impact that unrealistic beauty standards being pushed by society and social media has on people.
I haven't done much editing with it yet, but I am using a photo of myself with text and what will become a collage of images to emphasize my point.
